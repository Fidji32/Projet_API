Unfortunately, as this is one of my first projects on git, I made a tiny mistake. I forgot to provide the DB script that would run the application, and on top of that, I lost this famous file... ðŸ¤£  
As a result, the rest of the explanations aren't useful, but I'll leave them in case you need them.

Three accounts are available in the GIT database :
* moderator
    * mail : moderator@gmail.com
    * mdp  : azertyuiop
* publisher
    * mail : publisher@gmail.com
    * mdp  : azertyuiop
* publisher2
    * mail : publisher2@gmail.com
    * mdp  : azertyuiop
